The paper titled *Physics-guided Generative Cartoon Animation* emphasizes that it employs a novel approach to infuse physical information into the generative process. However, its method for injecting physical information relies on classical computer graphics techniques, specifically Delaunay triangulation [1] and Elasticity simulation [2]. Since these methods are well-established and not proposed by the authors, they cannot be considered as contributions of this paper. **Therefore, the evaluation of this paper should focus on whether using such methods to condition a video diffusion model for the cartoon animation creation task is reasonable and effective.**

 From the cases presented in the paper and the supplemental video, I believe that injecting traditional graphics-based constraints significantly limits the generative model's capabilities. After introducing these constraints, the proposed method is only suitable for generating animations with minimal semantic information and simple motions, such as the waving of flags, clothes, or hair. The cases provided in the paper and supplementary material only showcase such scenarios. As a side effect, other parts of the animation remain completely static. For instance, in the case of a character's hair waving, the character's facial expression remains unnaturally rigid and motionless. I argue that the effects achieved by this method should be more accurately described as *image dynamics* rather than *cartoon animation*. Cartoon animation involves a wide range of complex, semantically rich motions, such as changes in facial expressions or intricate character movements, rather than just simple oscillations. By injecting simulation results from traditional computer graphics methods, the proposed approach fundamentally binds the video diffusion model's generative potential to the limitations of the simulation. This restricts the model from generating more complex motions. Moreover, I believe that the lack of satisfactory results is not due to the limitations of the base model itself, but rather because the approach of using mesh geometry combined with elasticity simulation fundamentally constrains the generation of vivid motions. To address this issue, the paper attempts to use ToonCrafter to interpolate between the simulation results. However, this method clearly fails to solve the problem fundamentally. Therefore, I am on the negative side of the proposed technical approach in this paper.
